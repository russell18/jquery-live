	 	The first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.  The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules between competitors of different fighting disciplines like boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, and judo. In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.[8] In 2016, UFC's parent company, Zuffa, was sold to William Morris Endeavor (WME–IMG) for $4.2 billion
